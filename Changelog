May 11, 2009		0.99.2-beta1

December 01, 2008	0.99.1
	Removed the dummy Module.symvers file. While the build
	tested fine in the lab, real-world CentOS machines have
	their version checking on, making the modules look
	for version "0" of DAHDI symbols.
	Also please note, you can almost certainly safely ignore
	any warnings given during compilation. If there's an
	error, the build process will stop.
	As always, please report any bugs and issues to Rhino.

October 02, 2008	brycec	0.99
	Rhino's initial release of its DAHDI driver tree.
	These drivers should be considered BETA. We have tested
	them in our own lab, but they do not have real-world
	testing yet, due primarily to DAHDI's relative
	infancy.
	Please report any bugs and issues to Rhino.
